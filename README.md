=================

My customized, self-contained configuration for awesome window manager.

-----

[awesome][] is awesome. But customize it to taste takes time. This is to save the time.

Known to work well with *awesome v3.5.2 (The Fox).*

usage
-----

Clone to `$HOME/.config/awesome`

```bash
cd $HOME/.config && git clone https://github.com/pw4ever/awesome-wm-config.git awesome
```

feature

* *persistent dynamic tagging* across (both regular and randr-induced) restarts

* confirmation before quit/restart to minimize data loss accidents

* keyboard optimize for Arch Linux over Thinkpad W530 

* quick launch of common applications

* cycle through only the most sensible layouts
